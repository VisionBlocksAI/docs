# Health Check

The health check endpoint allows you to monitor the operational status of the VisionFly API. This endpoint is particularly useful for system monitoring and uptime checks.

## Endpoint

```http
GET /health
```

## Response

The endpoint returns a 200 OK response when the API is healthy and operational.

## Example Request

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.visionfly.ai/health
```

## Example Response

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2024-04-28T12:00:00Z"
}
```

## Use Cases

- System monitoring
- Uptime checks
- Load balancer health checks
- Automated monitoring systems

## Best Practices

- Implement regular health checks (e.g., every 30 seconds)
- Set up alerts for failed health checks
- Use this endpoint in your monitoring dashboard
- Consider implementing circuit breakers based on health check results
