Here's the comprehensive Best Practices section for your VisionFly API documentation:

# Best Practices

Follow these best practices to get the most out of VisionFly API and ensure optimal performance, security, and cost efficiency.

## Security

### API Key Management

- **Keep API Keys Secret**: Never expose API keys in client-side code. Make API calls from your server.
- **Rotate Keys Regularly**: Change your API keys periodically to minimize risk from potential exposure.
- **Use Environment Variables**: Store API keys in environment variables, not in your code repository.
- **Restrict API Access**: Apply IP restrictions when possible for additional security.

### Request Security

- **Use HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS when making API calls to ensure data is encrypted in transit.
- **Validate Input**: Sanitize and validate all inputs before passing them to the API, especially when using dynamic parameters.
- **Implement Timeouts**: Set reasonable timeouts for API requests to prevent hanging connections.

## Performance Optimization

### Caching

- **Implement Browser Caching**: Set appropriate cache headers on your frontend to avoid unnecessary API calls.
- **Cache Results**: Store transformed images in your own cache when appropriate.
- **Use CDN**: Place transformed images on a CDN for faster delivery to end users.

### Parameter Optimization

- **Resize at Source**: Resize images at the source when possible to reduce bandwidth usage.
- **Optimize Quality Settings**: Use the lowest acceptable quality setting for your use case (typically q70-q85 for webp).
- **Choose Appropriate Formats**: Use WebP for most web applications for its superior compression.

### Batch Processing

- **Preprocess Common Sizes**: For high-traffic images, preprocess and cache common transformations.
- **Batch Similar Operations**: When processing multiple images, group similar transformations together.

## Cost Efficiency

- **Only Transform What's Needed**: Only apply necessary transformations to minimize processing time.
- **Use Appropriate Dimensions**: Don't request larger images than needed for your application.
- **Monitor Usage**: Regularly review your API usage to identify optimization opportunities.

## Responsive Images

- **Serve Multiple Sizes**: Generate different image sizes for various viewport dimensions.
- **Use Image Sets**: Implement `srcset` in HTML to let browsers choose the appropriate image size.

```html Responsive Images
<img
  src="https://api.visionfly.ai/v1/transform/w800/example.com/image.jpg"
  srcset="
    https://api.visionfly.ai/v1/transform/w400/example.com/image.jpg   400w,
    https://api.visionfly.ai/v1/transform/w800/example.com/image.jpg   800w,
    https://api.visionfly.ai/v1/transform/w1200/example.com/image.jpg 1200w
  "
  sizes="(max-width: 600px) 400px, (max-width: 1200px) 800px, 1200px"
  alt="Responsive image"
/>
```

## Error Handling

- **Implement Graceful Fallbacks**: Handle API errors gracefully to maintain user experience.
- **Retry Strategy**: Implement exponential backoff for transient errors.
- **Log Failures**: Monitor and log API failures to identify patterns or issues.

## Image Quality

- **Balance Quality and Size**: Find the right balance between image quality and file size for your specific use case.
- **Test Across Devices**: Check how your transformed images look on various devices and screen sizes.
- **Consider Art Direction**: Use smart cropping for different aspect ratios rather than simple resizing.

## Privacy

- **Respect User Privacy**: Only process images that users have consented to process.
- **Delete When Done**: Remember that VisionFly doesn't store images permanently, but you should also avoid unnecessary retention of processed images.
- **Secure Image Transmission**: Always use HTTPS when displaying processed images.
